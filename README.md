# CS521-Final-Project: Dual-Interval Analysis for JAX jaxpr

Static Analysis of Automatic Differentiation via Dual-Intervals on JAX jaxpr

## Overview

This project implements dual-interval arithmetic for statically analyzing programs represented by the jaxpr (JAX expression) intermediate representation. The analysis provides sound overapproximations of both value and gradient bounds.
